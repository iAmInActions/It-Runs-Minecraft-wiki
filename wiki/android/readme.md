# Running Minecraft on Android
There are many methods of running Minecraft on Android. The following ones will be ranked from most practical to least practical.

# Method 1: Pojav launcher
Pojav launcher is one of the grand parents of Java Edition launchers for Android devices.
It had many improvements over the last month and does not only support vanilla Minecraft but also modded versions like OptiFine, Forge and Fabric.

To install it, simply download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases/latest/download/app-debug.apk)
and install it on your device. You may need to allow your web browser or file explorer to execute installation files in order to install it.

# Method 2: MCinaBox
MCinaBox is a bit slower than Pojav but what it loses in performance, it makes up in compatiblity.
It can run on nearly any mobile device with an arm processor and more than 512 mb of ram.

To install it, you will have to download the latest apk from [here](https://github.com/AOF-Dev/MCinaBox/releases/download/v0.1.4-p5-0119/MCinaBox.v0.1.4-p5-0119.apk) and install it.

You may need to allow your web browser or file explorer to execute installation files in order to install it.

You will also need the correct java runtime for your device. It can be [32 bit](https://github.com/AOF-Dev/MCinaBox/releases/download/v0.1.4-p2/aarch32-20200928.tar.xz) or [64 bit](https://github.com/AOF-Dev/MCinaBox/releases/download/v0.1.4-p5-0119/aarch64-20210204.tar.xz).

Once you have started the app, you will need to go into the settings and load the runtime. After that, you will be good to go.

# Method 3: Boardwalk Minecraft
Boardwalk is the oldest launcher for android. It has not been updated in years so versions newer than 1.11.x will not work at all.
Compatiblity is also very poor meaning that it will only work on a small amount of older 32 bit phones.

To install it, download this [apk file](https://m.apkpure.com/boardwalk/net.zhuoweizhang.boardwalk/download?from=details) and install it.

# Method 4: ARM Linux version in PcPhoneVM
This method is for experimental purposes only as it will run purely in software rendering mode and will need a usb keyboard in order to be playable.
You will also need to be familiar with linux and have a 64 bit phone.

Step 1:

Install PcPhoneVM from the [official website](http://mazegame.de/sites/projects/PcPhoneVM/index.html) by following the steps there.

Step 2:

Open up a terminal and follow the [ARM linux minecraft tutorial](https://github.com/iAmInActions/It-Runs-Minecraft-wiki/blob/main/wiki/linux/arm/readme.md).

Step 3:

Enjoy the lag and shitty controls ;-)
